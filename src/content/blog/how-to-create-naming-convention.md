Have you ever faced a problem finding which creatives have better results than others in your campaign? And then you get confused and don’t know how to decide which creatives are better than others.

You will rarely find online courses or webinars that teach how to create proper naming conventions for your ads.

In this article, I will show you how to create a Facebook ad naming convention and why you should implement it in your campaign.

## Why it is important

An ad naming convention is a system for consistently naming your ad campaigns, adsets, and ads. This is important for several reasons:

- It makes it easy to find and manage your ads.
- Quickly locate and analyze specific ads and ad sets.
- It lets you quickly identify which ads are performing well and which need improvement.
- Streamline the process of A/B testing and optimization

## Creating Facebook Ad Naming Convention

Here are the best practices to start creating a naming convention

- Identify the key elements of your ads. These elements include the campaign objective, target audience, ad format, or products.
- Decide the separator, and choose a consistent separator character (underscore, hyphens, pipe) to separate the elements in your ads.
- Use a spreadsheet to organize and make the naming creation easier.
- Be consistent in naming conventions across all campaigns, adsets, and ads.

## Example of Naming Convention

To illustrate how this works, here are a few examples of Facebook ad names using the naming convention:

### Level Campaign

> brands_productName_objective_funnel

example:

> Nike_airForce1_conversion_TOFU

Here is another sample of elements you can use in your campaign

> location_targetAudience_age_placement_optimization

Example:

> US_1% LLA_21–35_Advantage+\_HighVolume

Here is another sample of elements you can use in your adsets or adgroup

### Level Ads

> pagePathURL_PIC_contentType_angleContent_otherVariation

Example:

> air-force-1_arie_VideoReels_Unboxing_50%OFF

And here is another sample of elements you can use in ads level

What is the page path URL? A page path URL is the part of a web address that comes after the domain name.

example:

https://www.nike.com/shoes/air-force-1

The page path URL is:

- /shoes/
- /air-force-1

and you can use the last path URL as your element in the naming convention.

## How to use the naming convention to Track ad performance

In this case, I want to know which location performs better in my campaign. I want to compare the location between ZONE1 and ZONE2.
